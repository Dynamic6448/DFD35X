## Description
DFD35X is an open-source project started by Digital Flight Dynamics in order to create a realistic and high-quality Airbus A350 XWB for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
At the moment this project is still in very early stages, so if you contribute, we would highly appreciate it. If you want to follow our frequent progress updates, join our discord server above.

## Installation
If you want to install this aircraft, first beware that this project is nowhere near completion. It is still in early stages so don't expect too much out of it. To install the plane, first download the source code above. Once it is done downloading, extract the zip file. Open the folder, find "DFD35X Installer.exe" and run it. Choose the path to your community folder and then press install. Then you should be good to go!
