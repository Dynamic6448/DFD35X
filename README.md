## Description

DFD35X is an open-source project started by Digital Flight Dynamics in order to create a realistic and high-quality Airbus A350 XWB for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
At the moment this project is not complete, so you cannot use it properly in the simulator. It is still in very early stages so if you would like to contribute it would be highly appreciated if you do. If you want to follow our frequent progress updates, join our discord server above.
