DFD35X is an open-source project started by Digital Flight Dynamics in order to create a realistic and high-quality Airbus A350 XWB for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
At the moment this project is not complete, so you cannot use it properly in the simulator. If you want to follow our progress, join our discord server here:
